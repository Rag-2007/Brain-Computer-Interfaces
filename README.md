## Abstract

This repository presents two independent EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis project. The first system addresses **passive BCI** — the automatic detection of mental stress from scalp EEG using a Shallow Convolutional Neural Network trained on the SAM40 dataset. The second system addresses **active BCI** — four-class motor imagery classification using EEGNet on the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a, with direct application to assistive wheelchair control for individuals with motor disabilities.

Both systems are implemented in PyTorch and incorporate modern signal processing, deep learning, and evaluation methodologies aligned with current neuroscience and BCI research standards.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1 — Mental Stress Detection (Passive BCI)

> **Directory:** [`Stress_Detection/`](./Stress_Detection/)  
> **Full Documentation:** [`Stress_Detection/README.md`](./Stress_Detection/README.md)

Passive BCIs monitor the user's mental state without requiring deliberate control actions. This system continuously decodes **cognitive stress** from ongoing EEG activity, with applications in workplace ergonomics, driver monitoring, clinical psychiatry, and adaptive human-computer interaction.

**Core Methodology:**

| Component | Choice | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Dataset | SAM40 (40 subjects, 32 ch, 128 Hz) | Well-validated stress/relax paradigm |
| Preprocessing | Butterworth bandpass (0.5–40 Hz) + FastICA | Remove drift and ocular/EMG artifacts |
| Segmentation | 2 s sliding window, 50% overlap | Sufficient temporal context for oscillatory patterns |
| Normalisation | Z-score per channel (train statistics) | Prevents data leakage, handles inter-session drift |
| Model | ShallowConvNet (PyTorch) | Biologically motivated; learns FBCSP-equivalent features |
| Regularisation | Mixup augmentation + Label smoothing + Cosine annealing | Prevents overfitting on EEG data |
| Evaluation | 5-Fold Stratified Cross-Validation | Robust performance estimate; accounts for class imbalance |

**ShallowConvNet — Architecture Summary:**
```
Input (B, 1, 32, 640)
  → Temporal Conv (1×25)      [FIR filter bank equivalent]
  → Spatial Conv (32×1)       [CSP-equivalent spatial filtering]
  → Square → AvgPool → Log    [Log-band-power features]
  → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.5)
  → Linear → 2-class output   [Relax / Stress]
```

### Project 2 — Motor Imagery Classification (Active BCI)

> **Directory:** [`Motor_Imagery_Detection/`](./Motor_Imagery_Detection/)  
> **Full Documentation:** [`Motor_Imagery_Detection/README.md`](./Motor_Imagery_Detection/README.md)

Active BCIs translate voluntary cognitive intent — such as imagining moving a limb — into device commands. This system decodes four MI classes from EEG to enable non-muscular control of a motorised wheelchair, providing mobility assistance to patients with ALS, spinal cord injury, or locked-in syndrome.

**Core Methodology:**

| Component | Choice | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Dataset | BCI Competition IV 2a (9 subjects, 22 ch, 250 Hz) | Community benchmark; 4-class MI |
| Preprocessing | Drop EOG → Bandpass (4–40 Hz) → Notch (50 Hz) → 4 s epoching | Standard MI BCI preprocessing chain |
| Model | EEGNet-8,2 (PyTorch) | State-of-art compact CNN for EEG; ~2,500 parameters |
| Training | Adam, Cross-Entropy, 500 epochs | Stable convergence on small trial counts |
| Evaluation | Test accuracy + 4×4 Confusion matrix | Per-class discrimination analysis |

**EEGNet — Architecture Summary:**
```
Input (B, 1, 22, 1000)
  → Temporal Conv (1×64, F1=8)          [learned FIR filter bank @ F_s/2]
  → Depthwise Spatial Conv (22×1, D=2)  [CSP-equivalent spatial filter]
  → BatchNorm → ELU → AvgPool → Dropout
  → Separable Conv (1×16, F2=16)        [temporal feature aggregation]
  → BatchNorm → ELU → AvgPool → Dropout
  → Flatten → Linear → 4-class output   [LH / RH / Foot / Tongue]
```

## Background: Brain-Computer Interfaces

A **Brain-Computer Interface** is a system that establishes a direct communication pathway between the central nervous system and an external device, bypassing conventional neuromuscular pathways. BCIs hold transformative potential across:

- **Clinical / Assistive Technology** — restoring communication and mobility for paralysed patients (ALS, spinal cord injury, stroke, locked-in syndrome).
- **Neurological Rehabilitation** — motor recovery using BCI-driven neurofeedback.
- **Cognitive Monitoring** — real-time workload, stress, and fatigue assessment in aviation, medicine, and high-stakes professions.
- **Augmentation** — enhancing healthy human performance and enabling novel human-machine interaction paradigms.

### EEG as a BCI Sensing Modality

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most widely deployed BCI sensing modality due to its favourable trade-off between spatial resolution, temporal resolution, cost, and non-invasiveness.

| Modality | Temporal Res. | Spatial Res. | Cost | Invasiveness |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|
| **EEG** | **~1 ms** | ~1–2 cm | Low | Non-invasive |
| fMRI | ~1–2 s | ~1 mm | Very High | Non-invasive |
| ECoG | ~1 ms | ~1 mm | High | Semi-invasive |
| Spiking Arrays | ~0.1 ms | Single neuron | Very High | Fully invasive |

## Deep Learning for EEG: Context

Traditional EEG classification pipelines rely on hand-crafted spectral features (band-power, coherence) and spatial filters (CSP, beamforming) fed into linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or SVM classifiers. This two-stage approach is powerful but brittle — feature engineering must be redone for each paradigm.

Both ShallowConvNet and EEGNet replace this pipeline with **end-to-end learned representations** that are:
- **Task-adaptive** — filters emerge from data, not neuroscientist priors.
- **Jointly optimised** — spatial and spectral filters are co-trained.
- **Interpretable** — learned filters can be visualised via activation maximisation, saliency maps, and topographic projections.

The field has since evolved toward **Foundation Models for EEG** (e.g., LaBraM, BENDR), **Transformer-based architectures** (e.g., EEG-Conformer), and **Riemannian geometry** methods (MDM, TSMNet) — directions that extend naturally from the architectures implemented here.
